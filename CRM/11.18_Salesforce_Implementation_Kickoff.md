# Salesforce Implementation Kickoff with Solutions Architect

**Headline:** Establish Salesforce foundations before building—avoid Dynamics repeat

**What's new:** Nick Millsner (experienced Salesforce consultant) facilitated a 90-minute discovery session to align Forward Edge-AI on business model clarity, org structure, user roles, and sales process definitions before implementation begins.

**Why it matters:** Getting business model and process definitions right upfront prevents expensive rework (like the Dynamics mistakes) and ensures Salesforce scales with your growth from quick-start to full platform integration (Shopify, DocuSign, partner portals).

---

## Meeting Overview

- **Date:** Nov 18, 2024
- **Duration:** ~90 minutes
- **Attendees:**
  - Nick Millsner (Salesforce Solutions Architect, Reno NV)
  - Joey (Customer Success, Procurement lead)
  - Brandon Chapman (VP of Growth, Quote generation)
  - Mark (Sales, SDR support)
  - Justin McIntyre (System Admin)
  - Yanni (Finance/Operations, joined later)
- **Facilitator approach:** "Quick start" implementation (solve immediate needs, scale platform features over time)

---

## Critical Decisions Made

**Salesforce Edition:** Sales Cloud Enterprise (not Revenue Cloud—overkill for current state; Revenue Cloud deferred to future roadmap)

**Implementation approach:**
- Start with core sales process automation (no DocuSign integration in scope, but on roadmap)
- Phase 1: Sales pipeline, quotes, approvals, lead management
- Phase 2: Partner portal (Experience Cloud) and integrations
- Philosophy: Simple is better than perfect—add complexity only when justified

**Project management infrastructure:**
- Action items tracked in Notion (Joey single point of contact)
- Project archives in SharePoint (external link to minimize licensing)
- Time log reports auto-generated from consultant's PMS system

**Security/compliance note:** Need separate offline meeting (Joey, Brandon, Andrea/CIO, Justin) to design access/security model that passes SOX/HIPAA/ISO audits. George (CFO/COO) cannot have admin rights—violates segregation of duties.

---

## Approval Workflows (Current State → Future)

**Reseller Authorization:** CEO/COO approval required (very selective—avoids "Radio Shack" type partnerships)

**Quote/Discount Approvals:** George (CFO/COO) approves all quotes first year (pricing fairly rigid initially, more flexibility to come)

**NDA Execution (Critical step):** Currently manual email back-and-forth
- Process: Customer requests POC → NDA sent → Legal review → George signs → Hardware ships
- Future roadmap: Automate with DocuSign integration

**Deal Registration:** Partners registering new logos get higher discount than deals company routes to them (incentivizes partner prospecting)

---

## Business Model (Detailed)

See separate file: `Forward_Edge_Business_Model_Details.md`

**TL;DR summary:**
- **Revenue streams:** Hardware sales + per-device subscription + professional services (optional)
- **Main customer types:** Government (direct), Resellers/Partners (preferred), OEMs (integration)
- **Pricing tiers:** GSA schedule (baseline) → Reseller tiers (volume-based) → OEM/direct (1K and 20K unit breaks)
- **Device+SaaS model:** Minimum 2 devices as a pair; subscription is $100/device/month (covers device + management software + support)

---

## Sales Org Structure (Phase-in/Phase-out Model)

**Qualifying stage:** Mark + Brandon + SDRs (cold outreach, partner leads)

**Discovery stage:** Mark/Brandon → introduce Corey (Sales Engineer) for technical/network design questions; NDA execution begins

**Scoping stage:** Joey leads (POC document, decision-maker engagement, scope of work, consulting requirements)

**Validation stage:** Joey + Corey (successful POC execution, device shipment/demo, customer feedback)

**Contracts stage:** Brandon (quote generation) + George (CFO/COO approval) + legal (contract review)

**Closed stage:** Joey (post-sale coordination, procurement, customer onboarding)

---

## Current Salesforce Users (To Be Finalized)

**Confirmed:**
- Joey (Customer Success)
- Brandon (Sales/Quotes)
- Mark (Sales/Prospecting)
- Corey (Sales Engineer) — supporting access
- Yanni (Finance/Operations)
- Justin (System Admin)
- George Stevenson (CFO/COO) — reporting/visibility only, NO admin rights

**TBD:**
- How many SDRs will use the system?
- Will partners eventually have portal access? (Yes, future phase via Experience Cloud)
- Read-only vs. edit access for each role?

---

## Lead Sources & Qualification (Current & Future)

**Current lead sources:**
- Trade shows & conferences (manual capture)
- Website inbound forms (Joey processes)
- Partner-sourced deals (partners bring opportunities to FE)
- Outbound SDR prospecting (starting Dec 4)

**Lead qualification:** Currently ad-hoc (no formal checklist yet)
- Initial conversation → Partner/prospect expresses interest
- Followed by discussion under NDA (critical gate)
- POC request = qualified opportunity → hardware ships

**Future state (6-stage model):**
- Qualifying → Discovery → Scoping → Validation → Contracts → Closed
- Each stage has specific gates/deliverables (see Brandon's framework)

---

## Territory & Routing

**International:** Exclusive partnerships by territory (Japan example: Forage Japan joint venture)

**US:**
- Initially not exclusive (cherry-picking approach)
- Future: Government track vs. Commercial track (possible granular separation)
- Manufacturing partnerships may warrant dedicated territories

**Automation:** Not needed immediately; manual routing is fine for current volume

---

## Multi-Currency & Multi-Language

**Status:** Yes, needed for international expansion (explicitly noted but not detailed in this call)

---

## Follow-Up Action Items (Due Friday, Nov 22 @ 3PM Eastern)

**Security/Access Model (Team: Joey, Brandon, Andrea/CIO, Justin):**
- [ ] Build access control template (Nick will provide starter)

- [ ] Ensure compliance with SOX/HIPAA/ISO standards
- [ ] No admin rights for C-suite (George)

**Sales Stages & Process (Team: Joey, Brandon):**
- [ ] Refine Brandon's 6-stage framework (Qualifying → Discovery → Scoping → Validation → Contracts → Closed)
- [ ] Document key actions, tools, and pain points at each stage
- [ ] Create Lucidchart swim lane diagram (consultant will drop into template)

**Persona Mapping (Team: Joey, Brandon, Justin):**
- [ ] Define each user's responsibilities, goals, KPIs
- [ ] Map permissions needs to each persona
- [ ] Identify future reseller portal users

**Lead Qualification Checklist:**
- [ ] Define what makes a lead "qualified" in Salesforce

---

## Technical Notes

**Salesforce capabilities Nick highlighted:**
- Flexible security and sharing model (best-in-class compared to competitors)
- Flows (automation engine) replacing legacy Workflow/Process Builder
- Before-save vs. after-save flows (for field updates vs. related actions)
- Stage transitions can be manual (rep clicks) or automated (field-based triggers)

**Consultant's experience:** Multiple Salesforce implementations (successes and failures); specifically noted need to avoid "Dynamics trap" (learning tool while building everything)

---

## Next Steps

**This Week (Nov 18-22):**
1. Team prepares security/access model doc
2. Team finalizes 6-stage sales process
3. Team creates persona definitions
4. Nick provides templates and training module

**Friday, Nov 22 @ 3PM Eastern:** Follow-up call to review action items, finalize stages, discuss approval automation

**Week of Nov 25:** Begin Lucidchart swim lane diagram (mapping stages to team actions/tools)

**Dec 10 Target:** Go-live with Sales Cloud implementation

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Start simple, scale later** — Don't build everything perfectly upfront
✓ **Business model must be locked** — Clarify hardware/SaaS/services revenue flows before building
✓ **Security first** — Design access model with compliance in mind from day one
✓ **6-stage sales process** — Align team on common language (Qualifying → Closed)
✓ **Partner portal on roadmap** — Experience Cloud will eventually allow resellers to self-serve quotes
✓ **Approval workflows matter** — Automate where it makes sense (NDA → DocuSign); keep judgment calls manual (discounts → George approval)
