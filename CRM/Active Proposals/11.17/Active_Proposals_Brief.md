# Active Proposals Portfolio Review

**76 proposals span six competency areas with strong DoD focus**

What's new: Forward Edge-AI's active proposal portfolio shows 48% of opportunities have been formally reviewed, with Quantum & Autonomy commanding 37% of pipeline volume.

Why it matters: Our concentration in high-growth AI and autonomy sectors positions us well for government funding, but 51% of proposals remain pending review—a potential bottleneck for pipeline velocity.

## Top Agency Engagement

| Agency | Proposals | Focus Area |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **USAF** | 10 (13%) | Quantum, autonomy, AI systems |
| **Navy** | 5 (7%) | Naval systems, unmanned platforms |
| **Army** | 5 (7%) | Ground systems, digital modernization |
| **USSF** | 4 (5%) | Space technology and assurance |
| **SOCOM** | 4 (5%) | Special operations enablement |
| **DLA** | 4 (5%) | Business transformation, logistics |
| **CWMD Consortium** | 3 (4%) | CBRN/life sciences |

## Strategic Strengths

- **Autonomy dominance:** 28 proposals in AI/autonomy—our core competitive advantage
- **Diverse agency reach:** Presence across all major DoD branches plus civilian sector
- **Balanced proposal types:** Mix of RFPs, SBIRs, and publications (not over-dependent on one channel)
- **Defined timelines:** 65% have explicit deadlines—improving forecasting accuracy

---

## Gaps & Opportunities

**Immediate priorities:**
- **Reduce pending review rate:** 51% of proposals need formal vetting—establish review SLA to accelerate pipeline qualification
- **Categorize unassigned proposals:** 15 proposals (20%) lack competency mapping—limiting strategic prioritization
- **Expand CBRN positioning:** Only 9% of portfolio despite strong government emphasis on biodefense
- **Create cross-competency narratives:** Connect autonomy + digital transformation for integrated government solutions

**Longer-term:**
- Increase publication strategy (currently 13%) to build thought leadership in quantum/autonomy space
- Develop Space & Assurance capability set (5 proposals suggests emerging client interest)
- Benchmark against competitors' proposal volume in quantum and AI

---

## What's Next

**By end of November:**
- Complete review of 39 pending proposals
- Assign competency tags to 15 unassigned opportunities
- Identify top 10 highest-value opportunities by revenue potential and strategic fit

**By end of Q4:**
- Establish proposal review SLA (target: 90% reviewed within 5 business days)
- Develop AI factory narrative tying Isadora/Blaze to autonomy pipeline
- Launch CBRN thought leadership campaign (publications, webinars)

## Bottom Line

We have strong volume and agency reach, but need faster decision-making on pending proposals and clearer strategic focus on CBRN. The Quantum & Autonomy concentration is our competitive moat—leverage it to drive cross-sector wins in defense agencies.
