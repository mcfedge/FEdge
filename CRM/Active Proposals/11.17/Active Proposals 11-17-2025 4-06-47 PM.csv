Currently, without a Blue Object Management System, tracking and managing friendly assets relies on manual processes and disparate systems, leading to potential delays, inaccuracies, and reduced system interoperability. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), in partnership with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), presents the 2025 Blue Object Management Challenge, focused on advancing AI-enabled decision-making capabilities that improve how mission-critical data is integrated, accessed, and used across Department of Defense (DoD) platforms and forces. 

In military operations, “blue objects” refer to friendly forces which include U.S. warfighters, equipment, and infrastructure. Blue object management involves the real-time tracking and coordination of these assets, providing commanders with accurate, up-to-date operational awareness, particularly in dynamic or contested environments. 

This challenge seeks companies that are developing dynamic data integration solutions, smart databases, and sensing to enable AI-powered insights that provide insight into Blue Objects, at the speed of mission need.

Participation and selection in the challenge cohort serves as the entry point to a 12- week accelerator program designed for direct engagement with the DoD mission partners to understand real-world challenges, work closely with the accelerator team to test and validate technologies against national security applications, and build a foundation for doing business with the DoD. Selected companies will also gain access to a robust network of private investors and commercial partners."

The droppable chemical agent detection sensor is an ultra-compact, low SWaP, device designed to provide real-time detection, identification, and mapping of chemical warfare agents and VOC’s in operational environments. Engineered for deployment by aerial or ground uncrewed vehicles and individual personnel, the sensors provide rapid hazard awareness for Special Operations Forces. Once deployed, each sensor continuously monitors the environment, autonomously analyzing air samples and providing immediate detection alerts. Upon detection, the sensor generates geolocated data, automatically pushing its detection results and environmental metadata into ATAK.

 

Through embedded wireless mesh networking capability, the sensors create a resilient, scalable, detection grid, allowing the information or real-time hazard maps that update dynamically as threat presence change. Data is transmitted using Cursor-On-Target messages, enabling seamless interoperability with ATAK clients, WebTAK, WinTAK, and TAK servers. Sensor status, detection, and locations are visualized directly on the ATAK map, allowing users to rapidly assess affected areas and informing operational decisions.

 

Requirements for this development are as follows:

Drop Sensor SWaP:
<2.5” diameter, <1” height
Weight = <2.5 oz.
Scalable employment options for UAS employment
Capable of identifying a range of CWA and TIC; response time <5mins
48-hour battery life, extendable sleep mode option
Geolocated outputs; each detection tagged with GPS coordinates
Mesh Networking; multiple sensors interconnect to expand coverage and maintain communication in denied communications environments
Integration into the ATAK CBRNPI utilizing ProtoBuff programming language partnered with a DTRA-approved ATAK CBRNPI Developer
Drop-tested to MIL-STD-810G for ruggedization"

For nearly eight decades, the world has been navigating the dangers of the nuclear age. Despite Cold War tensions and the rise of global terrorism, nuclear weapons have not been used in conflict since Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Efforts such as strategic deterrence, arms control, non-proliferation agreements, and the U.S.-led global counterterrorism movement have helped to keep nuclear and other WMD incidents at bay. However, this success to date cannot be guaranteed in the future. U.S. efforts to counter nuclear or radiological terrorism are not keeping pace with the evolving threat landscape. The U.S. government should maintain a strategic focus and effort on combatting terrorism across the national security community in coordination with international partners, State, Local, Tribal and Territorial authorities, the National Laboratories, universities and colleges, and civil society. As well as developing and sustaining adequate CWMD incident response and recovery capabilities. DTRA is at the forefront of development of these capabilities."

A critical and timely consideration is the dual-use nature of these technologies, which serve both civilian and military purposes. While quantum technologies promise to revolutionize areas such as communication, sensing, computing, and cryptography, they also raise significant ethical, strategic, and policy challenges due to their dual-use potential. At the same time, the term “dual-use” is not clearly defined. Technology development often serves both civilian and non-civilian purposes. This can be driven from the civilian innovation landscape, turning into applications in the non-civilian domain - or vice versa.

This special collection explores the development, deployment, and implications of dual-use quantum technologies, focusing on the interplay between technology development, innovation policy, and strategic considerations. The collection aims to provide concrete and timely examples of the various aspects of dual-use R&D in the fields of quantum technology."
