# Week of Nov 14: Company Momentum Accelerates

**What's new:** Forward Edge-AI achieved major technical breakthroughs while government reopening released $1.5M in funding and resumed customer operations.

**Why it matters:** SmartBeam-Isidore integration is now operational, the executive dashboard is transforming project visibility, and compliance enforcement is becoming non-negotiable—all critical for scaling the company's growth trajectory.

## Technical Wins

**The big picture:** Three breakthrough innovations position us ahead of competition.

**SmartBeam QRC milestones:**
- **Patent-worthy polyphase filter** using dense neural network solves modulation challenges
- **Forward error correction breakthrough** potentially doubles packet reception while maintaining ultra-low latency
- **SmartBeam-Isidore integration achieved**—data transmission and decryption confirmed working
- AI network successfully integrated into FPGA for beam steering

**What's next:** Additional integration work required for full packet support over data link. Company-wide announcement planned upon completion.

**Yes, but:** 41 REVE-1 boards stuck in US customs since Tuesday—George and Chanel securing customs broker to resolve.

## Executive Dashboard Launch

**What's new:** Daniel's first iteration standardizes all boards with deliverables tracking, visual pie charts, and 90-day forward visibility.

**How it works:**
- Pulls directly from Jira (eliminates multiple spreadsheets)
- Overdue tab with clickable drill-down functionality
- Shows Customer Operations and partial Advanced Research Technology data
- NDF has 13 deliverables in next 9 days

**Enhancement roadmap:**
- Salesforce integration for CRM/proposals tracking
- Financial metrics integration (coordinate with Christina and Jordan)
- Tickler functionality for automated status requests on overdue items
- Executive task tracking for travel debriefs and compliance
- "Clickology" standard: maximum 3 clicks for any action

**Reality check:** May need additional contractor support given government reopening workload.

## Compliance Crackdown

**Why it matters:** Review-by-two policy violations persist across the organization—zero tolerance enforcement begins now.

**What's happening:**
- Direct conversations with violators planned over next two weeks
- Policy clear: **all external communications require second person review before sending**
- No exceptions moving forward

**Also:**
- Confluence migration to ForwardEdge AI on **November 22 at 5PM**
- All data migrated automatically, Gabriel becomes read-only for reference
- Maven AI assistant and Robo (ChatGPT-like interface) now available for document search
