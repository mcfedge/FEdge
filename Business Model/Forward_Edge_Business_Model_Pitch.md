Forward Edge-AI
AI-Powered Edge Devices with Flexible Revenue Models

---

The Problem
• Organizations struggle with rigid hardware purchasing models requiring large upfront capital expenditures
• Managing distributed AI edge devices across complex networks is operationally difficult without integrated software
• Buyers need OpEx-friendly solutions that spread costs over time instead of capital budget constraints
• Edge AI deployment requires expert implementation and ongoing professional support

---

Our Solution
• Dual purchasing model: One-time hardware purchases (government) or subscription-based leasing (commercial)
• Cassium management software bundled with every device for seamless operations and monitoring
• Monthly OpEx model allows customers to budget predictably and avoid large capital outlays
• Professional services framework for implementation, consulting, and network integration support

---

• TAM: Government & commercial sectors deploying edge AI (DoD, Air Force, Navy, enterprise organizations)
• SAM: Defense technology suppliers and edge AI infrastructure providers ($XX billion addressable market)
• SOM: Initial focus on government agencies + commercial resellers as distribution channel
• Market growth: Government AI adoption increasing, commercial edge AI deployment accelerating YoY

---

Product
• Ruggedized AI edge devices optimized for defense and enterprise deployment
• Cassium platform: Unified device management software (included in all subscriptions)
• Minimum 2-device 'pair' architecture for redundancy and autonomous operation
• Scalable from 2 devices to 20,000+ units across distributed networks

---

Traction
• Government relationships established (DoD agencies, Air Force inquiries)
• International expansion: Forage Japan joint venture for Asia-Pacific market
• Subscription-focused go-to-market reducing customer CapEx burden
• Professional services revenue supporting implementation and integration

Business Model
• 4 Primary Revenue Streams:
•   1. Hardware Sales: One-time purchases (gov) + subscription leasing (commercial)
•   2. Subscription Management (Cassium): $100/device/month bundled with hardware
•   3. Professional Services: Implementation, consulting, engineering support hours
•   4. Warranty & Support Packages: Multiple tier options (planning phase)
• 
• Pricing Architecture:
•   - GSA Schedule baseline (government rate = most-favored pricing)
•   - Reseller Tier 1: 15% discount (standard partners handling sales & customer relationships)
•   - Reseller Tier 2: 20% discount (1K+ devices/year volume threshold)
•   - Reseller Tier 3: 25% discount (20K+ devices/year volume threshold)
•   - OEM/Direct: Negotiated pricing up to 25% discount for high-volume integration partners
•   - Brought Deal Bonus: Additional 5% incentive for partner-sourced opportunities
• 
• Go-to-Market:
•   - Government: Direct sales (Forward Edge) or through registered reseller partners

• Bundled management software (Cassium) reduces customer integration complexity
• Hardware refresh incentives at renewal keep customers on latest technology
• Reseller-preferred model frees FE from managing every customer relationship
• GSA baseline pricing protects government pricing while allowing competitive reseller discounts
Competition
• Traditional hardware vendors (rigid purchasing, no integrated management)
• Cloud-only edge AI platforms (lack physical hardware, don't serve offline scenarios)
• Competitors offering lower reseller margins (unsustainable long-term)

Financials & Ask
• Subscription-focused revenue model targets 3x lifetime value vs. one-time hardware sales
• Recurring monthly revenue (MRR) from subscription contracts provides predictable cash flow
• Hardware refresh cycles (2-3 years) create upsell opportunities and customer retention levers
• Professional services margin supports operations and builds customer stickiness
