### Cassian Demo & Key Decision Needed (Isidore Units)

Team meshONE-T,

We need to schedule the **Cassian control platform demo** and confirm a critical decision regarding your incoming Isidore devices.

#### Key Ask: Should we wait for the Cassian release?

The Isidore models Forward Edge is preparing to ship you do not yet have the Cassian capability **fully deployed**. We need to discuss whether you want the loaner Isidore units **as they are**, or if you would rather **wait for the Cassian release** to be able to test capability more representative of a production environment.

#### Why it matters

This discussion helps keep the momentum going on our proposed alliance to achieve DAF Network of the Future objectives. The Cassian demo (delivered by Riaan, detailing Forward Edge-AI's accomplishment with the control platform) is assessed to be in your interest to **envision how you'd administer and defend multiple Isidore devices**.

#### Context

Riaan walked multiple Lumen folks through an **extensive demo** yesterday, November 17th. Lumen is our partner and is leading this deal. This is also a follow-up to an in-person demo previously delivered to Sev1 Tech.

#### What's next

Please reply with some dates and times that are good for you over the next **4 weeks** for the demo and discussion. We recommend setting aside **60-90 minutes** for the Cassian demo delivered remotely or hybrid (some in person, some via Teams pending date/time). We suggest allowing ample time for questions, as Riaan effectively handled previous challenging questions ("curveballs") yesterday.
