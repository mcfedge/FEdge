# Oracle Partnership Strategy: Moving to Marketplace Entry

**What's new:** Forward Edge is entering Oracle's partner marketplace at the entry level ($5K) and will drive the relationship through technical integrations and customer wins.

**Why it matters:** Oracle represents a $4-50B opportunity in public sector cloud licensing alone. Getting on the marketplace opens doors to existing Oracle customer relationships and potential fee waivers at higher partnership tiers based on demonstrated value.

## The Oracle Opportunity

**The big picture:**
- Oracle's public sector marketplace provides access to thousands of federal customers already committed to Oracle infrastructure
- If we capture even 0.5% of available contracts, the revenue potential is substantial
- Partnership at any tier opens us to Oracle's existing portfolio and co-selling opportunities

**Current status:**
- Contact Chen is managing intake; Lisa's team oversees partnership levels
- Available tiers: $5K (entry), $100K (mid), $500K (premium)
- We're starting at entry level to build credibility and explore cost waiver options at higher tiers

## Why AI Factories Matter to Oracle

**What we're hearing:**
- Oracle is heavily marketing AI factories as infrastructure solutions (built on OCI and NVIDIA GPUs)
- Lockheed Martin, HII, and other defense contractors are actively building AI factories
- Government agencies like Navy and HII see AI factories as enabling faster modernization cycles (reducing timelines from 30-40 years to 5-7 years)

**Our positioning:**
- Forward Edge's technology (Isadora, Blaze, Methodius) can enhance AI factory throughput and performance
- We need a clear AI factory narrative tied to our product roadmap and speeds
- **Key concern:** Our 500 meg and 50 gig speeds don't align with standard carrier infrastructure (10 meg, 100 meg, 1 gig, 10 gig, 100 gig)—we need to clarify whether these are real product specs or marketing projections

**What's next:**
- Brandon will develop a use case narrative connecting our platform to AI factory requirements
- Benchmark against competitors (some already offering 1 terabyte speeds)
- Create compelling white paper differentiating AI factories from traditional data centers

## Marketplace Entry Strategy

**Mark's role:** Lead marketplace signup and technical partnership discussions with Phil (Oracle's technical lead)

**Immediate actions:**
- Pay $5K entry fee and complete marketplace signup
- Build credibility through technical demos and proof points
- Identify specific customer wins within Oracle contracts that can be showcased

**Path to premium tiers:**
- Demonstrate value through customer wins and contract penetration
- Once we show Oracle how our tech opens doors they can't access alone, negotiating fee waivers becomes viable
- Target escalation with senior executives (Kim and Allen oversee public sector globally)

---

## Supporting Resources

**White papers needed:**
- Enterprise AI factories vs. traditional data centers (repurpose existing enterprise/data center white paper with GPU-specific content)
- AI factory architecture featuring Isadora roadmap speeds
- Company capability statement for industry organizations and forums

**Current assets available:**
- Door Quantum white papers by industry vertical (COC, critical infrastructure, gaming, telecoms, healthcare, aviation)
- Isadora roadmap in Confluence (check for Jan 2026 launch timelines—currently showing 500 meg ready by Feb 2025)

## Next Steps

**This week:**
- Mark confirms marketplace signup timeline with Chen
- Brandon schedules AI factory narrative development with Katie's team
- Eric or marketing team provides capability statement template for organizational registrations

**By December:**
- Escalate to senior Oracle contacts if entry-level partnership stalls
- Explore fee waiver discussions at leadership level
- Identify first customer wins to demonstrate marketplace value

## Key Contacts

- **Chen** (Oracle Partnership): Managing intake
- **Phil** (Oracle Technical): Marketplace technical requirements
- **Allen** (Oracle Public Sector, Global): Oversees strategic partnerships
- **Kim** (Allen's org): Final escalation point for fee negotiations
- **Patrick V** (Director of Partnerships): Previous contact, marketplace connections

## Bottom Line

Oracle marketplace entry at $5K is a low-cost gateway to a massive opportunity. Success depends on quickly building an AI factory narrative and securing early customer wins that demonstrate ROI to Oracle leadership.
