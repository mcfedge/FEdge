**Mission-First Product Development for Defense Tech**

**What's new:** Eric is sharing a Stanford H4D article on Palantir's mission-first approach—emphasizing customer discovery, rapid iteration, and incremental deployment over building perfect products in isolation.

**Why it matters:** This is how you build solutions customers actually want to buy. The tech-first approach (like DCGS-A's $11B failure) loses to mission-first every time.

**The Playbook:**

- **Discovery first:** Identify priority missions and deeply understand the problem from those experiencing it
- **Get to market fast:** Deploy at 60% capability, not 100% perfection
- **Iterate relentlessly:** "Build a little, test a little, use a little"—cycle feedback incorporation at speed
- **Maximize customer contact:** Embed with users as co-designers, gather quotes and testimonials, cultivate champions
- **Mission-focused metrics:** Define success by customer outcomes, not feature count

**Key insight:** Eric's earlier philosophy—"get the tech out, experiment, incorporate feedback FAST, iterate FAST"—predates Palantir and proves this approach wins in defense sales. Solve the customer problem first; profits follow.

**What to watch:** This framework directly applies to how we're approaching Isidore and our PoC deployments—customer-centric, iterative, outcome-driven.
