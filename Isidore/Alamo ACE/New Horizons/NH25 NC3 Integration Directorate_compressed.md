- AFNWC/NC was created in 2015 through AFI 13-550 to unify and integrate the entire AF NC3 Weapon System, combatting the past's fragmented management and stove-piped perspectives of NC3 systems  
Integrating programs and capabilities fielded over decades, with widely varying technology generations, compatibility, and operating philosophies  
- Critical to connecting the Nuclear Enterprise's internal and external stakeholders; including the White House, USSTRATCOM, USAF, USSF, USN, and others

# Integrates the AF NC3 Weapon System (AN/USQ-225)

Integration of the system of systems to enable smart modernization and adaption across the Department of the Air Force (DAF)

# Serves as AF NC3 Program Executive Officer (PEO)

AFNWC/NC is developing, producing, sustaining, and fielding AF NC3 systems across the Nuclear Enterprise

# Future of NC3 & Upcoming Opportunities

NC3-WS is the backbone of post-attack communication, designed to survive and operate under nuclear conditions. Failure of NC3-WS jeopardizes nuclear deterrence, impacting all other national defense plans

# Challenges

- Competition: Finite spectrum contested  
- Interference: RF signals disrupted  
Modernization: Legacy systems require update

# Solutions

Waveform Diversity: Enable adaptive operations  
Redundancy: Ensures continuous communication  
Adaptive Waveforms: Dynamically optimize performance

Trusted NC3- WS connects the Nuclear Enterprise—ensuring mission continuity from monitoring to force direction. Failure jeopardizes all other DoD operations.
