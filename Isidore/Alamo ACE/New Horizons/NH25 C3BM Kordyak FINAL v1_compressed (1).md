"We are to the joint and combined force what the headsman is to the executioner's ax—willful, disciplined, and premeditated direction of lethal means."

Future ("Blueprint" Draft Concept)

# The DAF BATTLE NETWORK is "The Stack" generalized into 4 categories:

o Secure Processing / Digital Infrastructure  
○ Software / Applications  
○ Connectivity  
Data

# C3BM seeks to integrate the larger stakeholder community around interoperable solutions to deliver the DBN

# The Challenges

1. Horizontal Integration: Creating a mechanism to integrate at a DAF BATTLE NETWORK system-of-systems level  
2. Complexity: Shifting complexity off the individual and onto the organization  
3. Value Flow: Driving programmatic content via DBN architecture in a systematic way  
4. Scale: Managing information flow to our vast stakeholder network at speed  
5. OT&E: Leveraging consistent venues for knowledge-sharing to unleash the full potential of the organization

# The Change

Establishing Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) to:

Create a battle rhythm for implementation planning and synchronization  
- Integrate the mission engineering work and system architecture strategies with the programmatic delivery

# How to Deliver the DAF BATTLE NETWORK

USAF & USSF Led IPTs Translate Architectures into Achievable Incremental Capability Deliveries Turning…

Architectures → Functional Decomposition → System-of-Systems → PoR Capabilities

Align on the operational problem to be solved – mission over function  
“Thin Slice” the product delivery

“Big Bang” acquisitions is out  
Simple, working systems, are in  
o Enabled by very rapid, iterative product deliveries (e.g. SWP)

Modularize the design

○ Reduce the number of interdependencies  
Target threat and technology clock-speeds  
Create "composable" systems

Tight coupling between ops, acquisition, and resourcing required

Complexity precludes accurate predictions of future  
o Requires robust experimentation between ops and acquisition  
Resources must be managed at the same level as the system-of-systems

System-of-Systems Architecture Must Beat Individual Systems For Success!
