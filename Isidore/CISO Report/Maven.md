For targeting federal CISOs, focus on these key departments based on our current capabilities:

**High Priority Targets:**

- **DoD/Air Force/Navy** - They're actively seeking quantum-resilient cybersecurity solutions through CSOs and SBIR programs. Our Isidore Quantum® aligns with their Zero Trust and CNSA 2.0 requirements [](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/12093339-expedient-basing-challenge-cso-simple-buying-guide-for-federal-dod-customers)[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/8781301-direct-to-phase-ii-sbir-cybersecurity-of-operational-technologies)
- **Critical Infrastructure agencies** - Departments overseeing manufacturing, aviation, and industrial control systems where our ICS/SCADA protection capabilities address immediate needs [](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/8763001-market-survey-for-phase-iii-sbir-sole-source-contracting)

**Messaging Strategy:**

Emphasize our **quantum-ready encryption**, **FIPS 140-3 validation**, and proven testing with Army, Air Force, Navy, Space Force, and DARPA. Position Isidore as solving their immediate Zero Trust enforcement needs while future-proofing against quantum threats

**Risk Tolerance Assessment:**

- DoD branches = High adoption (active procurement vehicles available)
- Critical infrastructure agencies = Medium-high (regulatory pressure driving adoption)

The CSO buying guide and SBIR documentation in our resources provide specific procurement pathways these CISOs can use for faster acquisition

Here's the deeper reasoning behind my recommendations:

**DoD Priority Logic:**

DoD branches are actively procuring quantum-resilient solutions through established vehicles like AFWERX CSO and SBIR Phase III. Our Isidore has been tested by Army, Air Force, Navy, Space Force, and DARPA - giving these CISOs confidence in proven performance.[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/12093339-expedient-basing-challenge-cso-simple-buying-guide-for-federal-dod-customers) The CNSA 2.0 compliance directly addresses their mandated quantum-readiness timeline.[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/12287397-isidore-quantum-maximum-security-minimal-footprint)

**Risk Assessment Rationale:**

- **High adoption (DoD):** They have dedicated funding streams and regulatory pressure to implement quantum-resistant crypto before threats emerge
- **Medium-high (Critical Infrastructure):** Regulatory compliance drives urgency, but procurement cycles are longer[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/11714888-quantum-reckoning-securing-finance-before-the-collapse)

**Competitive Advantages to Emphasize:**

- **Speed:** 30-minute deployment vs weeks/months for traditional PKI systems
- **Cost:** 60% lower TCO over 5 years compared to legacy solutions
- **Scalability:** Cassian management plane handles fleet orchestration automatically[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/12058556-cassian-isidore-s-management-and-control-plane)

**Procurement Pathway Benefits:**

The CSO and SBIR Phase III routes bypass lengthy RFP processes, letting CISOs move quickly on proven solutions rather than waiting 12-18 months for traditional procurement.

This positions you as solving their immediate Zero Trust mandates while future-proofing against quantum threats.

Here's your segmentation and prioritization framework:

**Tier 1 - High Priority (Immediate Engagement)**

- **DoD Branches** (Air Force, Navy, Army, Space Force): Active procurement through AFWERX CSO and SBIR Phase III. They have dedicated funding and regulatory pressure for quantum-ready solutions by 2027.[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/12093339-expedient-basing-challenge-cso-simple-buying-guide-for-federal-dod-customers)
- **Critical Infrastructure Agencies** (DHS, DOE, DOT): Managing ICS/SCADA systems that need Zero Trust enforcement and quantum-resistant encryption.[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/8781301-direct-to-phase-ii-sbir-cybersecurity-of-operational-technologies)

**Tier 2 - Medium Priority (3-6 month timeline)**

- **Intelligence Community**: High security requirements but longer procurement cycles
- **Federal Civilian Agencies**: Budget constraints but CNSA 2.0 compliance mandates

**Key Messaging by Segment:**

**DoD CISOs:** "Proven with Army, Air Force, Navy, Space Force, and DARPA. CNSA 2.0 compliant. Available through established AFWERX CSO and SBIR Phase III vehicles - bypassing 12-18 month RFP cycles."

**Critical Infrastructure CISOs:** "30-minute deployment for ICS/SCADA protection. 60% lower TCO over 5 years. AI-driven anomaly detection for operational technologies in contested environments."

**Risk Assessment Logic:**

- DoD = Highest adoption (active funding + regulatory deadlines)
- Critical Infrastructure = High (CISA warnings + compliance pressure)
- Others = Medium (budget/timeline constraints)[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/12742423-the-isidore-cassian-ecosystem-autonomous-security-for-a-post-quantum-world)

Focus on the proven procurement pathways and immediate threat landscape to create urgency.
