With a shift away from GWOT and a focus on multi-domain operations, USASOC is partnering with industry and academia to stay ahead of our near peer adversaries. USASOC’s ability to respond to a broad spectrum of operational needs requires that innovation and modernization is central to force development. As such, USASOC has created this open call to reflect five focus areas that support modernization across the USASOC enterprise.

These five are:

1. Deep Sense / Deep Strike (Focused on advanced sensing and precision engagement)
2. SOF AI (Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Special Operations)
3. Swarming (Heterogeneous or Homogeneous coordinated systems that operate autonomously or through one to many control)
4. Counter UxS (Combating Unmanned Systems)
5. Enhanced Capabilities (Empowering the future force)
    - Partner Force Enablement
    - Close Combat Lethality
    - Novel Communications
    - Alternative Data
    - Supply Chain Data
    - Intelligence Applications
    - Data Management Systems
    - Robotic Vehicles
