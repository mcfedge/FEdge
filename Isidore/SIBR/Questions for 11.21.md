### 1. What are the latest updates or changes to our SIBR process, especially as we transition CRM and proposal tracking to Salesforce and Memory Blue?

- (Context: Recent meetings mention a transition to Salesforce for pipeline management and a focus on improving proposal and lead tracking. Understanding process changes will help clarify how SIBR opportunities are managed and reported.)
    

### 2. Can you provide a current snapshot of our SIBR pipeline—what Phase I/II/III proposals or projects are active, and which are closest to award or major milestones?

- (Context: Recent status updates reference Army Phase I SBIR with Hypersphere, ongoing POCs in Asia, and several SBIRs in the pipeline. This question will help you get a clear, up-to-date overview.)
    

### 3. Are there any blockers or resource gaps in our current SIBR efforts (e.g., technical, contractual, or staffing) that need leadership attention?

- (Context: There are notes about needing to align resources for future phases, technical integration issues, and the importance of having the right people involved in proposal and POC execution.)
    

### 4. How are we validating and prioritizing SIBR opportunities in the pipeline, and what criteria are we using to decide which to pursue or accelerate?

- (Context: There have been recent discussions about pipeline validation, funding gates, and the need for intelligent prioritization at both macro and micro levels.)
    

### 5. What are the next key deliverables or decision points for our SIBR projects in the next 1-2 months, and how can I or the team best support those efforts?

- (Context: There are upcoming deadlines for POCs, proposal submissions, and integration milestones. Knowing what’s next will help you offer targeted support.)

1. **Current Pipeline**: What Phase I and Phase II SBIR awards do we have active right now, and which ones are ready to move to Phase III?[](https://support.forwardedge.ai/en/articles/8775745-commonly-asked-questions-phase-iii-sbir-sole-source)
2. **Basic Process**: Can you walk me through how we identify buyers for our SBIR work and connect our Phase I/II research to actual contracts?
3. **Data Rights Timeline**: Which of our SBIR projects are within the 5-year exclusive data rights window, and how does that affect our contracting strategy?
4. **Simple Acquisitions**: Are any of our current SBIR technologies suitable for simplified acquisition processes under the threshold limits?

These focus on the fundamentals - what we have, how the basic process works, timing considerations, and practical next steps for our specific situation.

#### 1. **Active Phase I SBIR Awards**

- From the [10-14NOV25](https://gabrielroboblocker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020651394fb455b447ead29be491a8ac549/pages/3366715394/10-14NOV25), there is an **Army Phase I SBIR** in progress involving Hypersphere, with a 6-month period ending in early February 2026. The team is working on agentic AI, data protection, and integration with Army Vantage (Palantir).
    
- There are references to other Phase I SBIRs in the pipeline, but the Army project is the only one explicitly detailed as active.
    

#### 2. **Active Phase II SBIR Awards**

- The [Documents Reviewed](https://gabrielroboblocker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020651394fb455b447ead29be491a8ac549/pages/2682323008/Documents+Reviewed) and [13-17OCT25](https://gabrielroboblocker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020651394fb455b447ead29be491a8ac549/pages/3285712899/13-17OCT25) confirm ongoing Phase II work, but do not list specific projects by name. However, there is mention of:
    
    - **Space COMSEC**: Deliverables due end of October, with ongoing demo and documentation work.
        
    - **SmartBeam**: Demo scheduled for late October, with integration work ongoing.
        
    - **Isidore Quantum**: Multiple references to ongoing development and integration, likely under Phase II or related R&D contracts.
        

#### 3. **SBIRs Ready to Move to Phase III**

- The [Documents Reviewed](https://gabrielroboblocker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020651394fb455b447ead29be491a8ac549/pages/2682323008/Documents+Reviewed) and [Documents Reviewed](https://gabrielroboblocker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020651394fb455b447ead29be491a8ac549/pages/2682323008/Documents+Reviewed) outline the requirements for Phase III transition:
    
    - Phase III is for commercialization, funded by non-SBIR sources.
        
    - Any project that has completed Phase II and demonstrated commercial potential is eligible.
        
- The [13-17OCT25](https://gabrielroboblocker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020651394fb455b447ead29be491a8ac549/pages/3285712899/13-17OCT25) mention a "PH3 Transition Tracker" (Slide 15), indicating that there is an internal tracking mechanism for projects ready to move to Phase III.
    
- **Candidates for Phase III** (based on context and readiness):
    
    - **Space COMSEC**: Deliverables and demos are wrapping up, suggesting readiness for commercialization.
        
    - **SmartBeam**: Demo and integration work are at a mature stage.
        
    - **Isidore Quantum**: Ongoing integration and customer pilots indicate near-term Phase III potential.
        

#### 4. **Additional Notes**

- There is a CRM and internal tracking system for SBIRs, including a "PH3 Transition Tracker" for monitoring which projects are ready for Phase III.
    
- For a full, up-to-date list of all active SBIRs and their status, the CRM or the internal "PH3 Transition Tracker" slide referenced in the 13-17OCT25 notes should be consulted directly.
