# Forward Edge-AI Internal Communications

Transform or generate internal communications using Smart Brevity® principles—a methodology designed for busy readers who want information they can trust, delivered efficiently and engagingly.

## Core Philosophy

Smart Brevity challenges you to share only what's vital and truly worthy of your reader's time and attention. Always start by asking:

**Two Essential Questions:**
1. **Who is my audience?** Write for a smart, curious person near the center of that group. Share what's essential and actionable for them. Cut away any context they already know.

2. **What do they know?** Raise the bar on what's worthy of their time, and pick updates with long-term impact. Ask yourself: Is this worth my audience dropping everything they're doing to read right now?

## Smart Brevity Structure

Every communication should optimize these four areas:

### 1. Headline (60 characters max)
This could be the subject of your email, title of your update, or header of your announcement.

- **Be brief**: Cap at ~60 characters—highly memorable for fast-moving readers
- **Be specific**: 59% of readers share a link without ever clicking it. Teach them something
- **Be conversational**: Keep content conversational and easy to consume

### 2. What's new: (One sentence)
The first sentence that tells your reader something essential.

- **Keep it to one sentence**: If you can guarantee readers remember one thing, make it this
- **Make it distinct**: Avoid repeating information or phrases from your headline

### 3. Why it matters: (One to two sentences)
The critical context that explains how this news impacts your reader.

- **Keep that smart reader in mind**: Why does this matter to them, specifically?
- **Answer in one or two sentences**

### 4. All remaining text
Style it to stay scannable and digestible.

- **Bullets** break up blocks of text and create easy-to-skim lists
- **Bolding** amplifies key points and pulls readers deeper
- **Links** provide access to related resources and deeper analysis

## Smart Brevity Axioms

Use these axioms to structure your content effectively:

### Core Story Elements

- **Why it matters:** To clearly explain your core point—and why your reader should care. Often the second beat in your story.
- **What's next:** To point to next steps or what to expect following your update.
- **The bottom line:** To wrap up your story with a clear and concise takeaway.
- **Go deeper:** To link out to longer or related stories and resources.

### Adding Detail

- **The big picture:** To point out a trend.
- **Between the lines:** To hedge or get into the weeds.
- **By the numbers:** To tee up data points.
- **How it works:** To outline the steps or instructions for a process.
- **Our thought bubble:** To offer a POV or expert analysis from the author or organization.
- **Yes, but:** To add a qualifier to a point, or introduce a counterpoint.
- **Context/Background/Flashback:** To point out specific historical context.

### Adding Variety

- **Where it stands:** To add context about what's happening now.
- **What they're saying/What we're hearing:** To incorporate new voices, commentary and insights.
- **Reality check:** To directly counter a point made by an outside source or speaker, based on internal expertise or data.
- **The other side:** To add counterpoints or objections to ideas you've explained, often citing an opposing person or group.
- **What to watch/What we're watching:** To highlight variables, potential trends or next steps that could shift outcomes down the road.
- **Driving the news:** To point to the event that triggered your coverage, often used to zoom in on a case study of a broader trend you want to explore.

## Implementation Instructions

### When Reformatting Existing Text

1. Identify the core message and key takeaway
2. Restructure using Smart Brevity format:
   - Create a concise, specific headline (~60 characters)
   - Write one sentence capturing "What's new"
   - Add 1-2 sentences explaining "Why it matters"
   - Break remaining content into scannable bullets with bold key points
3. Apply appropriate axioms (e.g., "The bottom line," "What's next," "By the numbers")
4. Remove redundancy and context the audience already knows
5. Add links for deeper resources rather than explaining everything inline

### When Generating New Communications

1. Clarify the topic, audience, and key message with the user if needed
2. Structure from the start using Smart Brevity format:
   - Lead with a compelling, specific headline
   - State what's new in one clear sentence
   - Explain why it matters to this specific audience
   - Use bullets, bolding, and axioms to organize remaining information
3. Keep it actionable—include "What's next" or clear calls to action
4. Ensure every element passes the "worth dropping everything" test

### Formatting Best Practices

- **Paragraphs**: Keep brief. If a paragraph exceeds 3-4 sentences, consider breaking it up or converting to bullets
- **Bullets**: Each bullet should be at least one sentence with sufficient context
- **Bold text**: Use sparingly to highlight key terms, numbers, or takeaways
- **White space**: Embrace it. Dense text blocks discourage reading
- **Length**: Shorter is almost always better. Challenge yourself to cut 25% after writing

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any communication, verify:

- [ ] Headline is under 60 characters and teaches something
- [ ] "What's new" captures the essence in one sentence
- [ ] "Why it matters" clearly connects to the audience's priorities
- [ ] Content is scannable (bullets, bolding, white space)
- [ ] Removed context the audience already knows
- [ ] Each section passes the "worth their time" test
- [ ] Included links for deeper exploration rather than lengthy explanations
- [ ] Actionable next steps are clear (when applicable)

## Example Transformation

**Before:**
"I wanted to take a moment to update everyone on the upcoming changes to our project management system. As many of you know, we've been working on improving our internal processes for quite some time now, and after careful consideration and multiple team discussions, we've decided to implement a new project management tool that we believe will significantly enhance our team's ability to collaborate and track progress on various initiatives. The rollout will begin next month and will involve training sessions for all team members."

**After:**
**New project management tool launches next month**

What's new: Forward Edge-AI is implementing a new project management system to improve team collaboration and progress tracking.

Why it matters: This tool will streamline how you coordinate on projects and give you better visibility into team priorities.

**What's next:**
- Training sessions for all team members begin in early December
- Pilot group starts using the system next week
- Full rollout completes by mid-December
